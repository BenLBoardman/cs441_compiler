**TODO**

boolean data type\
    new "bool" token
    parser changes in how types of some binary ops and variables are calculated
char data type
    same token/parse changes as before
    type info carried into backend and/or simulator/interpreter changes to run chars
    minor CFG tweaks
import classes from other files
    serialization
    some way to merge two CFGs (idea here would be that "library classes" could be created by serializing a CFG and then they'd be loaded by deserializing and prepending library CFGs to generated CFGs)
better CFG temp variable creation
    literally just a pile of refactoring
better error printing (line no., store errors and emit multiple later instead of immediately emitting and exiting when an error is found)
    track line numbers in tokenizer and parser
    ErrorManager class to accumulate errors and decide when to emit/abort
